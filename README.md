# Cod4-Deathrun

This is a project I worked on around the age of 12. It's a couple thousand lines of GSC, a scripting language utilized to control objects and events on a map built within COD4 Radiant.
The map was hosted on servers catering to thousands of different players, in which they would run through traps activated by a singlular player, attempting to survive and reach the end. More information about the mod for which this map was developed can be done by searching Call of Duty 4 Deathrun.
